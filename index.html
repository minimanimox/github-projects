        <h1>Basic Git commands</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Besides working around the file system and installing/uninstalling things, interacting with Git and online repos is probably the most common things you're going to use the terminal for as a developer.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at the most useful git commands out there </p>
        
        <commands>
            <h3>Command list</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Git add</dt>
                <dd>-Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.</dd>

                <dt>Git commit</dt>
                <dd>-Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.</dd>

                <dt>Git checkout</dt>
                <dd>-In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, it’s a way to work on a particular line of development.</dd>

                <dt>Git config</dt>
                <dd>-A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. You’ll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine.</dd>

                <dt>Git init</dt>
                <dd>-Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.</dd>

                <dt>Git log</dt>
                <dd>-Lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.</dd>

                <dt>Git status</dt>
                <dd>-Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. You’ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what’s being included in the next snapshot.</dd>

                <dt>Git push</dt>
                <dd>-Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.</dd>
